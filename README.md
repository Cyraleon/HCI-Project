# HCI-Project
Group G's project for HCI

Welcome to our project's repository. In it, you'll find a testing model for our remote as well as some concept art for what we're thinking our remote might look like. There will be some design documents outlining our thinking soon, if it's not there yet.

Google Docs containing some design information (work in progress): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X3Ju3D-G-cKP-5Pwo7U1hYT3uRilxewHwbPSd5E3gEM/ (use Laurentian account to view)
